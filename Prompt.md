# Learning Objectives Generator Prompt

## Instructions

Use this prompt to create effective learning objectives for your higher education course. Follow this structured approach to ensure your objectives are aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy and appropriate for your course level.

## Step 1: Identify Your Course Information

1. **Course Title**: [Enter the title of your course]
2. **Course Level**: [Select one: 100-level (introductory), 200-level (foundation), 300-level (intermediate), 400-level (advanced), or Graduate]
3. **Subject Area**: [Enter the subject area or discipline]
4. **Key Topics**: [List 3-5 major topics or concepts covered in your course]

## Step 2: Select Appropriate Cognitive Domain Levels

Based on your course level, focus primarily on these cognitive domains from Bloom's Taxonomy:

- **100-level courses**: Focus on Remember, Understand
- **200-level courses**: Focus on Understand, Apply
- **300-level courses**: Focus on Apply, Analyze
- **400-level courses**: Focus on Analyze, Evaluate
- **Graduate courses**: Focus on Evaluate, Create

## Step 3: Use Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verbs

Select action verbs that match your intended cognitive domain level:

### Remember (Knowledge)

*Recommended for 100-level courses*
- Define, identify, list, name, recall, recognize, reproduce, state, describe, label, match, outline, select

### Understand (Comprehension)

*Recommended for 100-200 level courses*
- Classify, compare, contrast, demonstrate, explain, illustrate, interpret, paraphrase, summarize, translate, discuss, distinguish, extend, predict, restate

### Apply (Application)

*Recommended for 200-300 level courses*
- Apply, change, compute, construct, demonstrate, discover, manipulate, modify, operate, predict, prepare, produce, relate, show, solve, use, calculate, complete, execute, implement

### Analyze (Analysis)

*Recommended for 300-400 level courses*
- Analyze, break down, compare, contrast, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish, examine, experiment, identify, illustrate, infer, outline, relate, select, separate, categorize, deconstruct, detect, test, question

### Evaluate (Evaluation)

*Recommended for 400-level and Graduate courses*
- Appraise, argue, assess, critique, defend, evaluate, judge, select, support, value, critique, debate, determine, prioritize, rate, recommend, verify

### Create (Synthesis)

*Recommended for Graduate courses*
- Assemble, construct, create, design, develop, formulate, generate, hypothesize, plan, produce, propose, compose, devise, invent, organize, synthesize, compile, reconstruct

## Step 4: Create Learning Objectives

For each major topic or concept, write 1-3 learning objectives using this format:

By the end of this [course/unit/module], students will be able to [action verb] [specific content/skill] [optional context/condition].

## Examples by Course Level:

### 100-Level (Introductory) Objective Examples:

- By the end of this course, students will be able to **identify** the primary components of the cell membrane.
- By the end of this unit, students will be able to **define** key economic terms related to supply and demand.
- By the end of this module, students will be able to **describe** the basic principles of classical conditioning.

### 200-Level (Foundation) Objective Examples:

- By the end of this course, students will be able to **explain** how political systems impact economic development.
- By the end of this unit, students will be able to **classify** different literary genres based on their characteristics.
- By the end of this module, students will be able to **demonstrate** proper laboratory safety procedures.

### 300-Level (Intermediate) Objective Examples:

- By the end of this course, students will be able to **apply** statistical methods to analyze research data.
- By the end of this unit, students will be able to **solve** complex differential equations using multiple techniques.
- By the end of this module, students will be able to **analyze** the causes and effects of historical social movements.

### 400-Level (Advanced) Objective Examples:

- By the end of this course, students will be able to **analyze** ethical dilemmas in professional practice using multiple ethical frameworks.
- By the end of this unit, students will be able to **critique** research methodologies in published studies within the field.
- By the end of this module, students will be able to **evaluate** competing theories of cognitive development.

### Graduate-Level Objective Examples:

- By the end of this course, students will be able to **develop** a comprehensive research proposal addressing a gap in current literature.
- By the end of this unit, students will be able to **synthesize** multidisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems in the field.
- By the end of this module, students will be able to **create** innovative strategies for implementing evidence-based practices in professional settings.

## Step 5: Review and Refine

Review your learning objectives to ensure they are:

- **Specific**: Clearly describes what students will learn
- **Measurable**: Can be assessed through assignments, exams, or activities
- **Achievable**: Realistic within the course timeframe
- **Relevant**: Connected to program and institutional outcomes
- **Time-bound**: Accomplishable within the course period

## Additional Considerations

- Ensure a balanced distribution of cognitive levels appropriate for your course level
- Include both content knowledge and skill development objectives
- Consider how each objective supports program-level and institutional learning outcomes
- Think about how each objective will be assessed and demonstrated
